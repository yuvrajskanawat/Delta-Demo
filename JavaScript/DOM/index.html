      <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
      <p id="description">In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
